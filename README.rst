OpenStack-Deploy Overview
=========================

The OpenStack-Deploy project
OpenStack-Deploy's mission statement is:

::

    OpenStack-Deploy provides production-ready deployment tools for
    operating OpenStack clouds.

OpenStack-Deploy provides `Centos7.3 <http://mirror.centos.org/>`__ os and
`Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/>`__ sls to meet OpenStack-Deploy's mission.
OpenStack-Deploy is highly opinionated out of the box, but allows for complete
customization. This permits operators with little experience to deploy
OpenStack quickly and as experience grows modify the OpenStack
configuration to suit the operator's exact requirements.
